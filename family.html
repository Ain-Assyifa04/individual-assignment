        <h1>My Family</h1>
    
                	<p>Hi, everyone! Here, I am going to talk about my family. My family consist of only four members, which are father, mother, older brother and me. Such a small family, right?</p>
				
			<p>My father's name is Norisam Bin Awang Kechik, 50 years old and had passed away in 2nd March 2021 because of dry cough. It was during my SPM's year. Meanwhile, my mother's name is Ruzita Binti Malik and 52 years old. They got married in 28th August 1995 and got my brother, Muhammad Aliff Naim Bin Norisam, 24 years old, and me, Ain Assyifa Binti Norisam, 20 years old.</p>

			<p>Currently, my mother is working as a chef at primary school canteen near my house. She wakes up at 4.30 a.m. just to cook for 400 students. She works there since I was 4 years old until now. She said if she's just staying at home, she will bored since there is no one at home.</p>

			<p>Next is the only and one brother I have. My older brother is staying at my aunt's house at Penang. He works at spare part factory. He only go home to visit my mother during weekend. Then, he will return to Penang back.</p>

			<p>Last but not least, me. I am currently studying at University Teknologi Mara (UiTM) Merbok branch Sungai Petani in Diploma in Information Management. Now, I am in my last semester. I am planning to pursue my study in Bachelor in Records Management at UiTM Puncak Perdana. Hopefully, I manage to continue my study in my dream course.</p>

			<p>My family doesn't have that much pictures because we are kinda anti with cameras. So, most of the time, we are avoiding to be captured. However, I do loves my family so much. Even though we are living such a simple life, but we are all happy and live peacefully.</p>
